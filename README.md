### awk-sed learning repo
*tutorial lessons, scripts and utility functions in awk, sed, mlr or other unix tools*

#### resources
- *sed & awk, 2nd Edition*, by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins, OReilly 
- note 2017-07-03: issues migrated to `repo/utility` for prod tools

#### todo:
- issues opened for utility functions like `hawkings` are being resovled in `repo/utility`. soo...
- maybe its smarter to develop within `awk-sed, datasci` etc and `utility` can be deprecated.
- **solution?:** open issues in utility repo for tools needing development
	+ awk-sed, datasci are learning repos, not project specific development
	+ tutorial and learning tasks are half-assed by definition
	+ `repo/utility` production code repo
	+ **SO:** move your issue opens from `(datasci, awk-sed) -> utility`

#### awk-sed
- this is a repo for learning awk, sed, mlr, and other unix tools.  it will serve as a reference for years to come.
- use the issues tracker to keep up with next tutorials and lessons.
- `handy` files are found in the `handy` repo, including for `awk/sed/mlr/java/osx, etc.`
- `utility` is for issues and development of actual production tools
- mastery requires four skills:
	+ how to use awk, sed or the program at hand
	+ regular expressions
	+ shell interaction
	+ script writing

#### contents
**1. awk**  
**2. sed**  
**3. mlr**  

#### production scripts
more often i have been taking ideas straight into usage without general study.  see the following repo:

	/mahiki/utility
			|----	startup-batch			# testing new scripts
			|---- shell					# production scripts

#### 1. awk
- basic file operations
- sum aggregates to degroup ('degroup'?)

##### sedawk-book
see readme here for study notes and chapter progress

#### 2. sed
- sed-mysteries. *puzzling stumpers that i had to deal with*
