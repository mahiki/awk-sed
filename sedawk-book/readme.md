### sed-awk book excercizes
    	../repo/awk-sed/sedawk-book/

using `hamlet.txt`

#### ch 3 regular expressions

extract headings from a group of chapter files

    	grep '\.H[123]' ch0[12]

for this directory, try this to return every line with 'awk', recursively and with filename in current directory.

	grep -rH 'awk' .

this pulls all the entrances in hamlet and counts them

	awk '/\[Enter/' hamlet.txt | wc -l
		61

similarly, there are 249 `[ ]` closed braces on a line, and 463 occurrences of `Ham`

##### character classes (`[   ]` members) in awk
	\ 	escapes special characters (awk only)
	-     indicates a range unless in first/last position
	^	reverse the match, if in first position

examples  
`[1-9]` 		the numbers 1 through 9  
`[A-Z]` 		capital letters.  
`[-/+*]` 		matches the arithmetic operators.
`[^0-9]`		to exclude a class of numbers, match every non-numeric character

###### egrep vs grep
POSIX standards cover non-english, and define classes with `[[:alpha:]]` and such.

egrep is the extended regular expressions

	Class	Matching Characters
	[:alnum:]	Printable characters (includes whitespace)
	[:alpha:]	Alphabetic characters
	[:blank:]	Space and tab characters
	[:cntrl:]	Control characters
	[:digit:]	Numeric characters
	[:graph:]	Printable and visible (non-space) characters
	[:lower:]	Lowercase characters
	[:print:]	Printable characters (includes whitespace)
	[:punct:]	Punctuation characters
	[:space:]	Whitespace characters
	[:upper:]	Uppercase characters
	[:xdigit:]	Hexadecimal digits‚Äù

The POSIX definitions will gradually become more prevalent, but you can see how awkward this is.

I think i'll ignore these.
